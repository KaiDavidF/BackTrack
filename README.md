# Path-Finding
A few days ago I started learning about path finding algorithms, so this is my first real implementation of the A* Search algorithm.
It is an informed search, so the algorithm always knows where the goal is.
By tracking which Node has the lowest distance to the goal, and which Node has the shortest path to the Start, the algorithm always finds the best path.
